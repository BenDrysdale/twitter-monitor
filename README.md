Twitter Monitor
===============

A twitter streaming library built on [Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) that enables dynamic term tracking.

Extend the JsonListener class to do something interesting with the tweets (like save them).

Extend the TermChecker class to get the filter terms from somewhere. A FileTermChecker (that repeatedly reads
 a term list file) is provided as an example.
